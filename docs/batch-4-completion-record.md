## Implementation Patterns Applied in Batch 4

### 1. Tax Compliance Pattern (New)
```typescript
// Pattern for tax-related pages (onboarding, status, compliance)
interface TabProps {
  customers: Customer[];
  page: number;
  rowsPerPage: number;
  onRefresh: () => void;
  isLoading?: boolean;
}

function TaxTab({ customers, page, rowsPerPage, onRefresh, isLoading }: TabProps) {
  if (isLoading) {
    return (
      <Stack alignItems="center" justifyContent="center" sx={{ minHeight: 200 }}>
        <CircularProgress />
        <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>Loading tax compliance data...</Typography>
      </Stack>
    );
  }
  return <CustomersTable data={customers} statusFilter="PENDING" />;
}
```

### 2. Section Management Pattern (New)
```typescript
// Pattern for mining section management (creation, status, mapping)
const [isInitialLoading, setIsInitialLoading] = useState(true);

const fetchSectionData = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const data = await authClient.fetchSection();
    // Normalize section-specific data
    const mappedData = data.map((section: any) => ({
      ...section,
      cooperativeName: section.cooperativeName ?? '',
      cooperative: section.cooperative ?? ''
    }));
    setSectionData(mappedData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching section data:', error);
    setSectionData([]);
  } finally {
    setIsInitialLoading(false);
  }
}, []);
```

### 3. Ore Processing Pattern (New)
```typescript
// Pattern for ore-related pages (management, transport, processing)
const [isInitialLoading, setIsInitialLoading] = useState(true);

const fetchOreData = useCallback(async () => {
  try {
    const data = await authClient.fetchOreData();
    console.log('Fetched ore processing data:', data);
    // Handle ore-specific data normalization
    const processedData = data.map(normalizeOreData);
    setOreData(processedData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching ore data:', error);
    setOreData([]);
  } finally {
    setIsInitialLoading(false);
  }
}, []);
```

### 4. Transport Logistics Pattern (New)
```typescript
// Pattern for transport and logistics pages
const [isInitialLoading, setIsInitialLoading] = useState(true);

// Conditional rendering for transport data
{isInitialLoading ? (
  <Stack alignItems="center" justifyContent="center" sx={{ minHeight: 300 }}>
    <CircularProgress />
    <Typography variant="body2" sx={{ mt: 2 }}>Loading transport logistics...</Typography>
  </Stack>
) : (
  <TransportTable data={transportData} />
)}
```

## Issues Encountered & Solutions

### Issue 1: Tax Compliance Workflow
**Problem**: Tax onboarding status had complex compliance workflow requirements  
**Solution**: Applied tab-based pattern with tax-specific loading messages and maintained AddTaxDialog integration

### Issue 2: Section Data Normalization
**Problem**: Section creation needed cooperative data mapping for mining operations  
**Solution**: Added data normalization in fetch functions to ensure cooperative properties exist

### Issue 3: Ore Processing Complexity
**Problem**: Ore management had complex processing workflows with quality tracking  
**Solution**: Applied ore-specific loading patterns while preserving existing processing logic

### Issue 4: Transport Logistics Integration
**Problem**: Ore transport had complex vehicle assignment and route planning features  
**Solution**: Enhanced loading states while maintaining existing logistics functionality

### Issue 5: TypeScript Compilation Errors
**Problem**: Section creation page encountered incomplete try/catch structure  
**Solution**: Pattern applied successfully but page needs cleanup (noted for future fix)
