- [ ] Add JSDoc comments where helpful

## Implementation Notes

### High Priority Pages (Complete First)
1. **Main Dashboard** - Central hub, affects user perception most
2. **Customer Management** - Core business functionality
3. **Status Pages** - Quick wins, similar patterns
4. **Onboarding Pages** - User-facing, high impact

### Medium Priority Pages
- **Management Pages** - Important but less frequent access
- **Tracking Pages** - Operational but can wait
- **Assignment Pages** - Administrative functions

### Low Priority Pages
- **Settings** - Configuration, less critical for performance
- **Account** - Personal settings
- **Integrations** - Technical configuration

## Success Metrics

### Performance Improvements
- [ ] Measure First Contentful Paint (FCP) before/after
- [ ] Track user-perceived loading time
- [ ] Monitor Core Web Vitals improvements
- [ ] Test with network throttling

### User Experience
- [ ] No blank screens during loading
- [ ] Consistent loading patterns across pages
- [ ] Clear visual feedback for all actions
- [ ] Graceful error handling
