## What Your Team Can Do Now

Your team can **immediately start implementing** the styling across all 12 routes without any blockers:

### 1. **Understand the Pattern** (30 minutes)
- Read `TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md` (high-level overview)
- Review `BATCH_IMPLEMENTATION_SCRIPT.md` (see code examples)
- Look at template in `useronboardstatus/page.tsx` (see actual styling)

### 2. **Implement Complete First Route** (1-2 hours)
- Follow the checklist in `TEAM_PLAYBOOK.md`
- Copy patterns from `BATCH_IMPLEMENTATION_SCRIPT.md`
- Use components from `approval-dialog-components.tsx`
- Test and verify build works

### 3. **Replicate to Remaining 11 Routes** (6-8 hours)
- Apply same pattern to each route
- Commit after each group (4 routes per developer)
- Team works in parallel: 4 developers = 2-3 hours total

### 4. **Deploy** (30 minutes)
- Final build verification
- Merge pull requests
- Deploy to production

## Timeline Projections

### Option A: Sequential (1 Developer)
```
Route 1:  1-2 hours   (Learning curve)
Routes 2-4:  2 hours   (Pattern replication)
Routes 5-7:  2 hours   (Different workflow type)
Routes 8-10: 2 hours   (Operations workflows)
Routes 11-12: 1.5 hours (Registration workflows)
Testing: 1 hour
─────────────────
TOTAL: 9-13 hours
```

### Option B: Parallel (4 Developers)
```
All routes implemented simultaneously:
TOTAL: 2.5-3.5 hours
+ 1 hour testing = 3.5-4.5 hours end-to-end
```
